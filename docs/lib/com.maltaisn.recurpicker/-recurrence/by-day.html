<p>Least-significant bit is <code>1</code> if the value is used, <code>0</code> otherwise.</p>
<p>If period is <a href="-period/-w-e-e-k-l-y.html">WEEKLY</a>, this value is a bit field of the days of the week on which
a weekly recurrence occurs. Bit field valid flags are the <a href="-days-of-week/index.html">DaysOfWeek</a> constants.
If value is <code>1</code> (i.e no flags set), events will happen on the same day of the week as start date's.</p>
<p>If period is <a href="-period/-m-o-n-t-h-l-y.html">MONTHLY</a>, the first byte is a bit field with a single <a href="-days-of-week/index.html">DaysOfWeek</a> flag set
indicating on which day of the week the events happen. The second byte is a number
indicating on which week of the month that the events happen, to which 4 is added.
Negative values start counting from the end of the month.</p>
