/**
 * An object describing a recurrence rule.
 * All recurrence objects are immutable.
 *
 * @property period The time period over which the recurrence happens.
 *
 * @property frequency The recurrence frequency i.e after how many periods to repeat the event.
 * For example, if period is daily and frequency is 2, events will happen every 2 days.
 * Frequency of [Period.NONE] recurrences is always 1.
 *
 * @property byDay First bit is `1` if the value is used, `0` otherwise.
 *
 * If period is [WEEKLY], this value is a bit field of the days of the week on which
 * a weekly recurrence occurs. Bit field valid flags are the [DaysOfWeek] constants.
 * If value is `1` (i.e no flags set), events will happen on the same day of the week as start date's.
 *
 * If period is [MONTHLY], the first byte is a bit field with a single [DaysOfWeek] flag set
 * indicating on which day of the week the events happen. The second byte is a number
 * indicating on which week of the month that the events happen, to which 4 is added.
 * Negative values start counting from the end of the month.
 *
 * @property byMonthDay If period is [MONTHLY], the day of the month on which the events happen.
 * The number must be between -31 and 31. If the value is `0` (the default),
 * the events will happen on the same day of the month as the start date's.
 * Negative numbers start counting from the end of the month.
 *
 * @property endType The rule for the recurrence end, see [EndType].
 *
 * @property endDate The end date if end type is [EndType.BY_DATE]. If not, end date is
 * always [DATE_NONE]. The end date is inclusive so the last event might be on the end date.
 *
 * @property endCount The number of events before the end of the recurrence if end type is
 * [EndType.BY_COUNT]. If not, end count is always `0`. Since the start date is exclusive,
 * the number of events never includes the start date event.
